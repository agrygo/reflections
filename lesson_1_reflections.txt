used diff -u file1  file2  in Git Bash to compare two files
viewing the diff helped to see the bugs by showing the actual differences in files.

Having easy access to the entire history of a file with commit comments will make me a better programmer in the long term to see what changes were made at a particular point and what those changes did or did not do.

pros and cons of manual changes to commits
pros: you pick when
cons: you might not remember, not autosave function

I think some vcs like Git allow to track multiple files since they interconnect, e.g. .html, .js, .css  whereas something like GoogleDocs to store a photo doesn't require that connectivity

git log shows the commit versions with a log id that can be used in git diff to see the differences between commits

version control rocks for trying out changes

I want to use Git for managing my coding files
